Gm Cantoversians,

Cantovapi is a standard and non-standard API for NFT data queries on canto. It's currently live in production, used in [cantoverse.net](https://cantoverse.net)

## Public Demo

The Public Demo is [Here](https://cantovapidemo.surge.sh/), and gives back the Turnstile NFT Balance (CSR) for a given ID.

Try with 602 (cantoverse)

## Non-Public Demo

Judges have private access to the full API for checking and testing.

Private Github: [Click Here](https://github.com/ngmisl/cantovapi-the_coh_6)

## Sustainability

The future of Cantovapi, if there is demand for it, can be bright:

1. Open Source
2. Open Access to Projects
3. Adding new endpoints based on requests

For this to be happening we have to upgrade the server, and potentially run our own RPC.

Thanks for your time and feedback and we hope that Cantovapi will become a great service for the whole Canto Ecosystem
